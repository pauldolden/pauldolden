## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github profile.  

I'm Paul Dolden, a developer from Essex, UK, who is invariably guilty of longing glances at shiny things �.

### Here you will find:

- 🔴 Things that I both am, and am not, actively avoiding working on.
- 🔴 A number of projects started and stopped in handful of different languages and frameworks (usually whichever is the shiniest).
- 🔴 A frustratingly low number of comments. 
- 🔴 Not nearly enough tests.
- 🔴 A distinct lack of open source contributions.
- 🟢 A developer desperately trying to be better.

### 🔨 I build stuff in

- TypeScript
- React
- NodeJS

### 💭 I'm looking to get into
- Svelte/Svelte Kit
- Remix
- Go
- Rust
