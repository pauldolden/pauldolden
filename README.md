### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Paul Dolden, a full-stack developer from Essex, UK.

Welcome to my Github profile. Here you will find:

- ğŸ”´ Things that I both am, and am not, actively avoiding working on.
- ğŸ”´ A number of projects started and stopped in handful of different languages and frameworks (usually whichever is the shiniest at the time).
- ğŸ”´ A frustratingly low number of comments. 
- ğŸ”´ Not nearly enough tests.
- ğŸ”´ A distinct lack of open source contributions.
- ğŸŸ¢ A developer desperately trying to be better on all counts.
