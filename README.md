### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Paul Dolden, a full-stack developer from Essex, UK.

I'm an infuriatingly curious developer, who is invariably guilty of longing glances at shiny things.

Welcome to my Github profile. 

# Here you will find:

- ðŸ”´ Things that I both am, and am not, actively avoiding working on.
- ðŸ”´ A number of projects started and stopped in handful of different languages and frameworks (usually whichever is the shiniest).
- ðŸ”´ A frustratingly low number of comments. 
- ðŸ”´ Not nearly enough tests.
- ðŸ”´ A distinct lack of open source contributions.
- ðŸŸ¢ A developer desperately trying to be better.

# I build stuff in

- TypeScript
- React (w/ Gatsby or NextJS)
- NodeJS

# I'm looking to get into
- Svelte/Svelte Kit
- Remix
- Go
- Rust
